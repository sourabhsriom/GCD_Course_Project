==================================================================
This codebook describes the run_analysis program, its variables 
and the the calculations done on the.
==================================================================

The data given to us is from 30 different users. 24 of them have been randomly selected to populate the training data set. 
The remaining 6 form the test data set.

For each record we have been provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset included the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features which are the variables that we will be analysing.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name i.e. it links the numeric values assigned to an activity to the activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set. Contains 24 users.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. Contains the numeric ID of the training users.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. Contains the numeric ID of the test users


The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

The file activity_names.txt present in this repository lists all the features that have been used to perform the analysis.
Along with the names, berif description of all the activities and their units are mentioned.
